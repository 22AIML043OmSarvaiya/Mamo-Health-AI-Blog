# 🌐 My Summer Internship Journey: Building **Mamo Health AI** – An AI-Powered Healthcare Platform

This summer, I had the opportunity to work on a project that blends two of the most impactful fields of our time: **Artificial Intelligence** and **Healthcare**. As part of my internship and final-year project, I developed **Mamo Health AI**, a comprehensive healthcare web application designed to provide **intelligent health monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized recommendations** using **Google Gemini APIs**.

## 🚀 The Idea Behind Mamo Health AI

Digital health is no longer the future—it’s the present. From **fitness tracking apps** to **AI symptom checkers**, technology has already started transforming how people engage with their health. However, most existing solutions (like Ada or Babylon) have limitations such as **limited personalization, lack of scalability, or high computational requirements**.

This motivated me to design **Mamo Health AI**, a project that focuses on:
✅ **API-first architecture** (scalable & lightweight)
✅ **Preventive health monitoring** (not just diagnosis, but early detection)
✅ **Accessibility** (affordable, global, and AI-driven)

## 🏗️ The Technical Stack

Mamo Health AI was built with a **modern, API-first architecture**, making it flexible and easy to scale.

* **Frontend**: React 18 + Tailwind CSS (responsive & mobile-first)
* **Backend/API Gateway**: Flask / Node.js
* **AI Integration**: Google **Gemini API** for chatbot, symptom analysis, and recommendations
* **Database**: Firebase / SQLite for health logs and chatbot history
* **State Management**: React Context API

📊 **System Flow**:
**User → React Frontend → API Gateway → Gemini API + Database → Health Insights**

## 🧠 Core Features

Mamo Health AI is more than just a chatbot. It includes multiple **healthcare modules**, such as:

1. **Dashboard & Analytics** – Health score tracking, progress visualization
2. **Symptom Checker** – AI-powered health risk evaluation using Gemini prompts
3. **Health Chatbot** – Conversational interface for medical queries
4. **Risk Prediction** – API-driven early intervention insights
5. **Nutrition Management** – Personalized diet and calorie tracking
6. **Fitness Tracking** – Customized workouts, progress monitoring
7. **Mental Health Support** – Mood tracking, stress management, mindfulness tools
8. **Image Analysis (Future)** – AI-assisted skin and medical image analysis
9. **Emergency Services** – Quick access to medical help and critical health data
